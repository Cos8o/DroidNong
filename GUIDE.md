# Guide

To install nongs on android you will need a file explorer, and a modified version of GD, which you can find [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/t4wynsftd98zmju/nong-hack.apk/file). Of course, you also need the nongs, which must be MP3 files.

Install the provided apk, then open the file explorer, and locate your nongs (perhaps under the `Download` folder?). When you're ready, you have to copy the nongs inside a specific folder, called, you wont believe it, `nong`. This folder must be created in the main folder of your local storage, that is, the very first directory your file explorer opens, which will most likely be the directory where the `Download` folder is. This main directory is usually referred as `/storage/emulated/0`, or by its symlink `/sdcard`.

After copying your nongs, you have to rename every nong into the song ID you want to replace, ie. if you want to replace [At the Speed of Light](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/467339) with your own nong, you will rename your nong into `467339.mp3`, where 467339 is the song ID you find in the newgrounds URL of the song.

When you're done, simply run the modified GD client. The nongs will be copied into the songs folder; if there's a copy conflict, your nong will overwrite the old song. To restore a song, use the in-game downloader. After the installation, every nong in the `nong` folder gets deleted, so if you wish to install back a nong, you will have to re-do the steps.

**Note:** installing huge/many nongs at once may slow down the game load time by a lot.
